Overview
The MTree.cpp program implements a tree data structure (referred to as MTree) in C++. The code is likely used for organizing data in a hierarchical structure, and may include methods for insertion, traversal, and search.

Features
Implementation of an MTree data structure.
Methods for adding nodes, searching, and possibly traversing the tree.
Demonstrates recursive and iterative tree operations.

Requirements
C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later (e.g., g++ or clang++).

Compilation
To compile the program, run:
g++ -std=c++11 -o MTree MTree.cpp

Running
After compilation, run the executable:
./MTree

Notes
Explore the comments and code structure for insights into the tree operations.
Intended for academic or demonstrative purposes.
